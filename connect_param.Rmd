title: "Connectivity parameterisations"
output: html_notebook
---

This script creates a series of connectivity layers. The layers differ by having different parametrisations - e.g., different sized dispersal kernels, or thematic resolutions of shelter quality etc. The code loops through all of these combinations of parametrisations and produces each of the connectivity layers.
